# hello-world
its always a tradition to begin a journey by saying hello to the world...its a sign of humility

it all started when my cousin gifted me a video game, i fell into imagination and curiousity of what made the objects move as i directed them; i saw the objects right on the screen yelling, moving, fighting 
then i said i want to study whatever that will quench my curiousity not knowing i wouldnt be quenching it but will be put in a more starvy and thirsty land. the land of the codes
today i am here more thirsty, more hungry for more, for more, for more...would it ever get filled?
